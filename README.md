# Note Taker 

## Description
The Note Taker application uses front-end and back-end software to create a webpage where the user can add and save notes. New notes can be added to the right, and old notes will be listed along the left side of the page. Each note will have a unique id and will be saved to the db.json file upon saving to the page.

## Installation
To run this application from vs code, you first want to run "npm i" in the terminal. Next, you will run "node server.js" which will provide the url for you to click on. This application is also deployed live using Heroku and can be used by adding a new title and text for your note, and hitting the save button to add the new note to the page.

## Usage

## Credits
For this assignment we were provided with starter code, including all the code for the front-end. I used past class activities and examples as references when working on this assignment. I also worked with my tutor when I hit a roadblock.
